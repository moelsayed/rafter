**Rafter is looking for new maintainers**

The project will no longer be developed within the `kyma-project` organization.
Contact us if you are interested in becoming a new maintainer.
If we fail to find new maintainers, the project will be archived.
Until than, no new fetures will be developed and maintanance will be limited to bare minimum.

## Overview

Rafter is a solution for storing and managing different types of files called assets. It uses [MinIO](https://min.io/) as object storage. The whole concept of Rafter relies on [Kubernetes custom resources (CRs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) managed by the [Rafter Controller Manager](./cmd/manager/README.md). These CRs include:

- Asset CR which manages single assets or asset packages from URLs or ConfigMaps
- Bucket CR which manages buckets
- AssetGroup CR which manages a group of Asset CRs of a specific type to make it easier to use and extract webhook information

Rafter enables you to manage assets using supported webhooks. For example, if you use Rafter to store a file such as a specification, you can additionally define a webhook service that Rafter should call before the file is sent to storage. The webhook service can:

- Validate the file
- Mutate the file
- Extract some of the file information and put it in the status of the custom resource

Rafter comes with the following set of services and extensions compatible with Rafter webhooks:

- [Upload Service](./cmd/uploader/README.md) (optional service)
- [AsyncAPI Service](./cmd/extension/asyncapi/README.md) (extension)
- [Front Matter Service](./cmd/extension/frontmatter/README.md) (extension)

> **NOTE:** To learn how Rafter is implemented in [Kyma](https://kyma-project.io), read [Rafter](https://kyma-project.io/docs/master/components/rafter) documentation.

### What Rafter is not

- Rafter is not a [Content Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) (Wordpress-like),
- Rafter is not a solution for [Enterprise Content Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_content_management),
- Rafter doesn't come with any out-of-the-box UI that allows you to modify or consume files managed by Rafter.

### What Rafter can be used for

- Rafter is based on [CRs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). Therefore, it is an extension of Kubernetes API and should be used mainly by developers building their solutions on top of Kubernetes,
- Rafter is a file store that allows you to programmatically modify, validate the files and/or extract their metadata before they go to storage. Content of those files can be fetched using an API. This is a basic functionality of the [headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system) concept. If you want to deploy an application to Kubernetes and enrich it with additional documentation or specifications, you can do it using Rafter,
- Rafter is an S3-like file store also for files written in HTML, CSS, and JS. It means that Rafter can be used as a hosting solution for client-side applications.

## Quick start

Try out [this](https://katacoda.com/rafter/) set of interactive tutorials to see Rafter in action on Minikube. These tutorials show how to:

- Quickly install Rafter with our Helm Chart.
- Host a simple static site.
- Use Rafter as [headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system) with the support of Rafter metadata webhook and Front Matter service. This example is based on a use case of storing Markdown files.
- Use Rafter as [headless CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system) with the support of Rafter validation and conversion webhooks. This example is based on a use case of storing [AsyncAPI](https://asyncapi.org/) specifications.

> **NOTE:** Read [this](./docs/development-guide.md) development guide to start developing the project.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
